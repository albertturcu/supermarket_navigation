# EXPO REACT NATIVE APP

## How to run the app:

1. In terminal/command line navigate to the project folder and inside */frontend/supermarket_navigation*
2. For android execute: `npm run android`
For ios execute: `npm run ios`
For web execute: `npm run web`
3. If you have local environment set up, such as xcode and ios simulators(not available on windows) or visual studio and android emulators, the app will start automatically in a simulator/emulator. If you don't have any of the above, download app called **Expo Go** and scan the QR displayed in terminal to run the app.
4. Alternatively, if you are going to run the app through Expo Go, you can execute:
`npm start` and this will start only the development server and give you a QR that you can use in the app on your phone.
5. Expo works with auto updates so make sure that your server stays connected while you develop and the app will reload every time you make some changes in the code.
